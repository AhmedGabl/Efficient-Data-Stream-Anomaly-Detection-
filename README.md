# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an efficient implementation of real-time anomaly detection in a continuous data stream. The Python 3.x-based solution simulates a data stream with seasonal patterns, trends, and noise, while occasionally injecting anomalies (spikes). The detection algorithm uses a rolling Z-score approach, which is both effective and computationally efficient for continuous, unbounded streams of data.

## Features

- **Simulated Data Stream**: Generates synthetic data with a seasonal component, trend, random noise, and occasional anomalies.
- **Rolling Z-Score Anomaly Detection**: Monitors the data stream and detects anomalies in real-time using a Z-score-based method.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays the data stream with anomalies marked in red as the data is processed.
- **Error Handling & Data Validation**: The code includes robust error handling and validation to ensure the correctness and stability of the process.
- **Minimal External Libraries**: Only essential libraries (`numpy` and `matplotlib`) are used to maintain lightweight implementation.

## Algorithm Explanation

### Rolling Z-Score Anomaly Detection:

The algorithm works by maintaining a rolling window of the most recent data points, calculating the mean and standard deviation within this window, and then using these to compute the Z-score for each new data point. A Z-score measures how many standard deviations a point is from the mean. If the Z-score exceeds a certain threshold (in this case, `3`), the point is flagged as an anomaly.

This method is effective for real-time anomaly detection because:
- It efficiently processes unbounded data streams.
- It adapts to changes in the data distribution by using a rolling window.
- It is simple yet powerful, requiring only basic statistical calculations.

## Screenshot

Here’s an example of the real-time visualization showing detected anomalies:

*Be sure to include a screenshot of your actual output and save it as `screenshot.png` in the project root.*

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- **Required Libraries**: The following libraries are needed and can be installed using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  Alternatively, install them manually:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
  ```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedGabl/anomaly-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd anomaly-detection
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python anomaly_detection.py
   ```

### Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the `anomaly_detection.py` file to experiment with different settings:
- `WINDOW_SIZE`: The size of the rolling window for calculating mean and standard deviation.
- `Z_THRESHOLD`: The Z-score threshold to classify a point as an anomaly.
- `SEASONALITY_PERIOD`: Defines how often the seasonal component repeats.
- `ANOMALY_PROBABILITY`: The probability of randomly injecting an anomaly.

### Error Handling and Validation

The script includes several error handling mechanisms:
- **Non-Numeric Data**: The algorithm validates that incoming data points are numeric.
- **Rolling Window**: Ensures that the Z-score calculation is only performed once enough data points are available in the rolling window.
- **Exception Handling**: Any unexpected behavior is caught, and informative error messages are logged.

### Example Output

- **Data Stream**: A line plot representing the real-time data stream.
- **Anomalies**: Red dots indicating data points flagged as anomalies based on their Z-scores.

## How to Take a Screenshot

1. Run the script as described above.
2. Wait for the plot to detect some anomalies (red points).
3. Capture the screen:
   - **Windows**: Press `PrtScn`, paste in Paint, and save as `screenshot.png`.
   - **macOS**: Press `Command + Shift + 4`, drag to capture, and save as `screenshot.png`.
   - **Linux**: Use `Shift + PrtScn` or a screenshot tool.
4. Save the screenshot in the project directory with the name `screenshot.png`.

## Included Files

- **`anomaly_detection.py`**: The main Python script for generating data, detecting anomalies, and visualizing results.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the minimal list of external libraries required for the project.
- **`screenshot.png`**: (Optional) A screenshot showing the real-time detection output, which can be included after running the project.
